                <p><b>1. Skate or Sled in Boston Common</b>
                    <br>Unleash your inner Michelle Kwan (or perhaps just try to make it around a lap without falling) on the Frog Pond in Boston Common. Set in the heart of the oldest public park in the country, this beloved pond is home to a skating school, and offers skate rentals, including seal-shaped aids to help little ones (or wobbly adults) find their balance.</p>

                <p><b>2. Walk the Freedom Trail</b>
                    <br>While a smattering of snow might make it hard to spot the 2.5-mile-long red-brick line marking the Freedom Trail in winter, it's still one of the best places to visit in Boston. This long, winding path passes 16 of the city's most important historic sites, including the Massachusetts State House, Old South Meeting House, Old State House, and the site of the Boston Massacre.</p>

                <p><b>3. Admire the View from the Prudential Skywalk Observatory</b>
                    <br>The most incredible view of Boston can be found at the Prudential Skywalk Observatory. The best time to visit is during the late afternoon, when you can watch the sunset alight the sky with pink and orange hues.
                    Set on the 50th floor of the Prudential Building, the Skywalk Observatory is one of the top tourist attractions in Boston. Visiting during the winter rewards travelers with an impeccable, 360-degree view of the snowcapped brownstones, powder-laden streets, frozen Charles River, and whitewashed Boston Common.</p>

                <p><b>4. Watch a Play in the Theater District</b>
                    <br>Boston's main theater district consists of over a dozen venues set in the downtown core. Whether you're looking to attend a Broadway musical, Christmas-themed performance, or dance show, you'll find it all (and so much more) in this glitzy area.
                    <br><br>
                    Even if you aren't a fan of opera, you should visit the iconic Boston Opera House. A Washington Street staple, this lovely Baroque building is an example of luxury at its best. During the months of November and December, this is where you'll find The Nutcracker ballet, a holiday season must-see, especially for those traveling with kids.</p>

                <p><b>5. Cheer for the Home Team at a Celtics or Bruins Game</b>
                    <br>It's easy to get excited while watching a game at the TD Garden. The official home of basketball legends the Boston Celtics (they've won 17 NBA Finals) and hockey champs the Boston Bruins, this popular sports and entertainment venue is the largest of its kind in New England.
